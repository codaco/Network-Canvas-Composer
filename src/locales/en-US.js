      <p>
        Each information interface can display up to four

        either: text, an image, a video, or some audio.
      </p>

        You can use markdown style syntax to add formatting to your text. Supported formatting
        includes headings, bold, italic, and external links.

        choose from your existing node types, or create a new one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of the node&apos;s &quot;type&quot; as its most fundamental attribute. To ascertain
        what it may be, ask yourself what the node represents. For example, is it a person? A place?
      </p>
      <p>
        Node types are fundamental to the way that Network Canvas works. A node&apos;s type
        determines its visual properties, as well as the variables available to assign on
        other interfaces.

        obscure the node list, and will stay open and focused while the participant types,
        providing an ideal environment for quickly listing off names.

      <p>This function bypasses the new node form, and no other node attribute data collection is

      <p>
        Name your variable meaningfully, and in a way you will remember and recognise.
        Variable names are used when exporting interview data, so it is a good idea to

        or relevance.
      </p>
      <h4>Type</h4>
      <p>
        The variable type determines how and where you can use it within your interview, as
        well as the characteristics of the data it will collect. Because of this, you should
        be certain that the variable type you choose here is correct. It is not easily possible

      <h4>Validation</h4>
      <p>
        The validation section allows you to define constraints on your variable that must be
        fulfilled. These constraints will depend on the type of variable you are editing. For
        example, a categorical variable will let you limit the minimum and maximim number of
        options that must be selected, whereas a text variable will let you set the minimum and
        maximum length.
